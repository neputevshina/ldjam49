# BARABANNAYA MATEMATIKA'S LIGHTNING BALL RAMPAGE
**UPD**: absolute dogshit. 1000+-th place. Do not play.
[Entry for LD Jam 49](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/lightning-ball-rampage) made by [@kuamarin](https://github.com/kuamarin), DISN and me.

Also [itch page](https://neputevshina.itch.io/lbr)!

If you have any issues running builds send an issue to this repo ~~or write a comment on LD site~~.
## Build
Just clone and run `go build`. Will work on Windows and Mac (all tested) too. 

**WARNING** If you do this be sure you using go at least 1.16 since it has `embed` package. Go from Ubuntu's repo is outdated. Use builds if in doubt. 

~~Play from itch.io app~~ Use Firejail if you don't trust my code. It will sandbox it.
